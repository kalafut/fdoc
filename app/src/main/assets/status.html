<pre>Usage: fossil status ?OPTIONS?

Report on the status of the current checkout.

Pathnames are displayed according to the "relative-paths" setting,
unless overridden by the --abs-paths or --rel-paths options.

Options:

   --abs-paths       Display absolute pathnames.
   --rel-paths       Display pathnames relative to the current working
                     directory.
   --sha1sum         Verify file status using SHA1 hashing rather
                     than relying on file mtimes.
