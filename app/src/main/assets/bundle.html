<pre>Usage: fossil bundle SUBCOMMAND ARGS...

  fossil bundle append BUNDLE FILE...

     Add files named on the command line to BUNDLE.  This subcommand has
     little practical use and is mostly intended for testing.

  fossil bundle cat BUNDLE UUID...

     Extract one or more artifacts from the bundle and write them
     consecutively on standard output.  This subcommand was designed
     for testing and introspection of bundles and is not something
     commonly used.

  fossil bundle export BUNDLE ?OPTIONS?

     Generate a new bundle, in the file named BUNDLE, that contains a
     subset of the checkins in the repository (usually a single branch)
     described by the --branch, --from, --to, and/or --checkin options,
     at least one of which is required.  If BUNDLE already exists, the
     specified content is added to the bundle.

        --branch BRANCH            Package all check-ins on BRANCH.
        --from TAG1 --to TAG2      Package checkins between TAG1 and TAG2.
        --checkin TAG              Package the single checkin TAG
        --standalone               Do no use delta-encoding against
                                     artifacts not in the bundle

  fossil bundle extend BUNDLE

     The BUNDLE must already exist.  This subcommand adds to the bundle
     any checkins that are descendants of checkins already in the bundle,
     and any tags that apply to artifacts in the bundle.

  fossil bundle import BUNDLE ?--publish?

     Import all content from BUNDLE into the repository.  By default, the
     imported files are private and will not sync.  Use the --publish
     option makes the import public.

  fossil bundle ls BUNDLE

     List the contents of BUNDLE on standard output

  fossil bundle purge BUNDLE

     Remove from the repository all files that are used exclusively 
     by checkins in BUNDLE.  This has the effect of undoing a
     "fossil bundle import".
