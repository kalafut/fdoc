<pre>Usage: fossil add ?OPTIONS? FILE1 ?FILE2 ...?

Make arrangements to add one or more files or directories to the
current checkout at the next commit.

When adding files or directories recursively, filenames that begin
with "." are excluded by default.  To include such files, add
the "--dotfiles" option to the command-line.

The --ignore and --clean options are comma-separate lists of glob patterns
for files to be excluded.  Example:  '*.o,*.obj,*.exe'  If the --ignore
option does not appear on the command line then the "ignore-glob" setting
is used.  If the --clean option does not appear on the command line then
the "clean-glob" setting is used.

If files are attempted to be added explicitly on the command line which
match "ignore-glob", a confirmation is asked first. This can be prevented
using the -f|--force option.

The --case-sensitive option determines whether or not filenames should
be treated case sensitive or not. If the option is not given, the default
depends on the global setting, or the operating system default, if not set.

Options:

   --case-sensitive <BOOL> override case-sensitive setting
   --dotfiles              include files beginning with a dot (".")
   -f|--force              Add files without prompting
   --ignore <CSG>          ignore files matching patterns from the
                           comma separated list of glob patterns.
   --clean <CSG>           also ignore files matching patterns from
                           the comma separated list of glob patterns.
