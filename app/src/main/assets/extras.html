<pre>Usage: fossil extras ?OPTIONS? ?PATH1 ...?

Print a list of all files in the source tree that are not part of
the current checkout.  See also the "clean" command. If paths are
specified, only files in the given directories will be listed.

Files and subdirectories whose names begin with "." are normally
ignored but can be included by adding the --dotfiles option.

The GLOBPATTERN is a comma-separated list of GLOB expressions for
files that are ignored.  The GLOBPATTERN specified by the "ignore-glob"
is used if the --ignore option is omitted.

Pathnames are displayed according to the "relative-paths" setting,
unless overridden by the --abs-paths or --rel-paths options.

Options:
   --abs-paths      Display absolute pathnames.
   --case-sensitive <BOOL> override case-sensitive setting
   --dotfiles       include files beginning with a dot (".")
   --header         Identify the repository if there are extras
   --ignore <CSG>   ignore files matching patterns from the argument
   --rel-paths      Display pathnames relative to the current working
                    directory.
