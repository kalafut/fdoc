<pre>Usage: fossil clean ?OPTIONS? ?PATH1 ...?

Delete all "extra" files in the source tree.  "Extra" files are
files that are not officially part of the checkout. This operation
cannot be undone. If paths are specified, only the directories or
files specified will be considered for cleaning.

You will be prompted before removing each eligible file unless the
--force flag is in use or it matches the --clean option.  The
GLOBPATTERN specified by the "ignore-glob" setting is used if the
--ignore option is omitted, the same with "clean-glob" and --clean
as well as "keep-glob" and --keep.  If you are sure you wish to
remove all "extra" files except the ones specified with --ignore
and --keep, you can specify the optional -f|--force flag and no
prompts will be issued.  If a file matches both --keep and --clean,
--keep takes precedence.

Files and subdirectories whose names begin with "." are
normally kept.  They are handled if the "--dotfiles" option
is used.

Options:
   --allckouts      Check for empty directories within any checkouts
                    that may be nested within the current one.  This
                    option should be used with great care because the
                    empty-dirs setting (and other applicable settings)
                    belonging to the other repositories, if any, will
                    not be checked.
   --case-sensitive <BOOL> override case-sensitive setting
   --dirsonly       Only remove empty directories.  No files will
                    be removed.  Using this option will automatically
                    enable the --emptydirs option as well.
   --dotfiles       Include files beginning with a dot (".").
   --emptydirs      Remove any empty directories that are not
                    explicitly exempted via the empty-dirs setting
                    or another applicable setting or command line
                    argument.  Matching files, if any, are removed
                    prior to checking for any empty directories;
                    therefore, directories that contain only files
                    that were removed will be removed as well.
   -f|--force       Remove files without prompting.
   --verily         Shorthand for: -f --emptydirs --dotfiles
   --clean <CSG>    Never prompt for files matching this
                    comma separated list of glob patterns.
   --ignore <CSG>   Ignore files matching patterns from the
                    comma separated list of glob patterns.
   --keep <CSG>     Keep files matching this comma separated
                    list of glob patterns.
   -n|--dry-run     If given, display instead of run actions.
   --temp           Remove only Fossil-generated temporary files.
   -v|--verbose     Show all files as they are removed.
