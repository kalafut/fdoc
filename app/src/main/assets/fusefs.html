<pre>Usage: fossil fusefs [--debug] DIRECTORY

This command uses the Fuse Filesystem to mount a directory at
DIRECTORY that contains the content of all check-ins in the
repository.  The names of files are DIRECTORY/checkins/VERSION/PATH
where DIRECTORY is the root of the mount, VERSION is any valid
check-in name (examples: "trunk" or "tip" or a tag or any unique
prefix of a SHA1 hash, etc) and PATH is the pathname of the file
in the checkin.  If DIRECTORY does not exist, then an attempt is
made to create it.

The DIRECTORY/checkins directory is not searchable so one cannot
do "ls DIRECTORY/checkins" to get a listing of all possible checkin
names.  There are countless variations on checkin names and it is
impractical to list them all.  But all other directories are searchable
and so the "ls" command will work everywhere else in the fusefs
file hierarchy.

The FuseFS typically only works on Linux, and then only on Linux
systems that have the right kernel drivers and have install the
appropriate support libraries.

After stopping the "fossil fusefs" command, it might also be necessary
to run "fusermount -u DIRECTORY" to reset the FuseFS before using it
again.
