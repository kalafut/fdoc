<pre>Usage: fossil sqlite3 ?DATABASE? ?OPTIONS?

Run the standalone sqlite3 command-line shell on DATABASE with OPTIONS.
If DATABASE is omitted, then the repository that serves the working
directory is opened.  See https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html for additional
information.

WARNING:  Careless use of this command can corrupt a Fossil repository
in ways that are unrecoverable.  Be sure you know what you are doing before
running any SQL commands that modifies the repository database.

The following extensions to the usual SQLite commands are provided:

   content(X)                Return the contenxt of artifact X.  X can be a
                             SHA1 hash or prefix or a tag.

   compress(X)               Compress text X.

   decompress(X)             Decompress text X.  Undoes the work of
                             compress(X).

   checkin_mtime(X,Y)        Return the mtime for the file Y (a BLOB.RID)
                             found in check-in X (another BLOB.RID value).

   symbolic_name_to_rid(X)   Return a the BLOB.RID corresponding to symbolic
                             name X.

   REGEXP                    The REGEXP operator works, unlike in
                             standard SQLite.

   files_of_checkin          The "files_of_check" virtual table is
                             available for decoding manifests.

Usage example for files_of_checkin:

    CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE temp.foci USING files_of_checkin;
    SELECT * FROM foci WHERE checkinID=symbolic_name_to_rid('trunk');
