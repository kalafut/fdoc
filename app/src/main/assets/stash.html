 fossil stash
 fossil stash save ?-m|--comment COMMENT? ?FILES...?
 fossil stash snapshot ?-m|--comment COMMENT? ?FILES...?

    Save the current changes in the working tree as a new stash.
    Then revert the changes back to the last check-in.  If FILES
    are listed, then only stash and revert the named files.  The
    "save" verb can be omitted if and only if there are no other
    arguments.  The "snapshot" verb works the same as "save" but
    omits the revert, keeping the check-out unchanged.

 fossil stash list ?-v|--verbose?
 fossil stash ls ?-v|--verbose?

    List all changes sets currently stashed.  Show information about
    individual files in each changeset if -v or --verbose is used.

 fossil stash show ?STASHID? ?DIFF-FLAGS?

    Show the content of a stash

 fossil stash pop
 fossil stash apply ?STASHID?

    Apply STASHID or the most recently create stash to the current
    working check-out.  The "pop" command deletes that changeset from
    the stash after applying it but the "apply" command retains the
    changeset.

 fossil stash goto ?STASHID?

    Update to the baseline checkout for STASHID then apply the
    changes of STASHID.  Keep STASHID so that it can be reused
    This command is undoable.

 fossil stash drop ?STASHID? ?-a|--all?
 fossil stash rm   ?STASHID? ?-a|--all?

    Forget everything about STASHID.  Forget the whole stash if the
    -a|--all flag is used.  Individual drops are undoable but -a|--all
    is not.

 fossil stash diff ?STASHID?
 fossil stash gdiff ?STASHID?

    Show diffs of the current working directory and what that
    directory would be if STASHID were applied.
