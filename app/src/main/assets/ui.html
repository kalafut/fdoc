<pre>Usage: fossil server ?OPTIONS? ?REPOSITORY?
   Or: fossil ui ?OPTIONS? ?REPOSITORY?

Open a socket and begin listening and responding to HTTP requests on
TCP port 8080, or on any other TCP port defined by the -P or
--port option.  The optional argument is the name of the repository.
The repository argument may be omitted if the working directory is
within an open checkout.

The "ui" command automatically starts a web browser after initializing
the web server.  The "ui" command also binds to 127.0.0.1 and so will
only process HTTP traffic from the local machine.

The REPOSITORY can be a directory (aka folder) that contains one or
more repositories with names ending in ".fossil".  In this case, the
a prefix of the URL pathname is used to search the directory for an
appropriate repository.  To thwart mischief, the pathname in the URL must
contain only alphanumerics, "_", "/", "-", and ".", and no "-" may
occur after "/", and every "." must be surrounded on both sides by
alphanumerics.  Any pathname that does not satisfy these constraints
results in a 404 error.  Files in REPOSITORY that match the comma-separated
list of glob patterns given by --files and that have known suffixes
such as ".txt" or ".html" or ".jpeg" and do not match the pattern
"*.fossil*" will be served as static content.  With the "ui" command,
the REPOSITORY can only be a directory if the --notfound option is
also present.

By default, the "ui" command provides full administrative access without
having to log in.  This can be disabled by setting turning off the
"localauth" setting.  Automatic login for the "server" command is available
if the --localauth option is present and the "localauth" setting is off
and the connection is from localhost.  The optional REPOSITORY argument
to "ui" may be a directory and will function as "server" if and only if
the --notfound option is used.

Options:
  --localauth         enable automatic login for requests from localhost
  --localhost         listen on 127.0.0.1 only (always true for "ui")
  -P|--port TCPPORT   listen to request on port TCPPORT
  --th-trace          trace TH1 execution (for debugging purposes)
  --baseurl URL       Use URL as the base (useful for reverse proxies)
  --notfound URL      Redirect
  --files GLOBLIST    Comma-separated list of glob patterns for static files
  --scgi              Accept SCGI rather than HTTP
