<pre>Usage: fossil commit ?OPTIONS? ?FILE...?

Create a new version containing all of the changes in the current
checkout.  You will be prompted to enter a check-in comment unless
the comment has been specified on the command-line using "-m" or a
file containing the comment using -M.  The editor defined in the
"editor" fossil option (see fossil help set) will be used, or from
the "VISUAL" or "EDITOR" environment variables (in that order) if
no editor is set.

All files that have changed will be committed unless some subset of
files is specified on the command line.

The --branch option followed by a branch name causes the new
check-in to be placed in a newly-created branch with the name
passed to the --branch option.

Use the --branchcolor option followed by a color name (ex:
'#ffc0c0') to specify the background color of entries in the new
branch when shown in the web timeline interface.  The use of
the --branchcolor option is not recommended.  Instead, let Fossil
choose the branch color automatically.

The --bgcolor option works like --branchcolor but only sets the
background color for a single check-in.  Subsequent check-ins revert
to the default color.

A check-in is not permitted to fork unless the --allow-fork option
appears.  An empty check-in (i.e. with nothing changed) is not
allowed unless the --allow-empty option appears.  A check-in may not
be older than its ancestor unless the --allow-older option appears.
If any of files in the check-in appear to contain unresolved merge
conflicts, the check-in will not be allowed unless the
--allow-conflict option is present.  In addition, the entire
check-in process may be aborted if a file contains content that
appears to be binary, Unicode text, or text with CR/NL line endings
unless the interactive user chooses to proceed.  If there is no
interactive user or these warnings should be skipped for some other
reason, the --no-warnings option may be used.  A check-in is not
allowed against a closed leaf.

If a commit message is blank, you will be prompted:
("continue (y/N)?") to confirm you really want to commit with a
blank commit message.  The default value is "N", do not commit.

The --private option creates a private check-in that is never synced.
Children of private check-ins are automatically private.

The --tag option applies the symbolic tag name to the check-in.

The --sha1sum option detects edited files by computing each file's
SHA1 hash rather than just checking for changes to its size or mtime.

Options:
   --allow-conflict           allow unresolved merge conflicts
   --allow-empty              allow a commit with no changes
   --allow-fork               allow the commit to fork
   --allow-older              allow a commit older than its ancestor
   --baseline                 use a baseline manifest in the commit process
   --bgcolor COLOR            apply COLOR to this one check-in only
   --branch NEW-BRANCH-NAME   check in to this new branch
   --branchcolor COLOR        apply given COLOR to the branch
   --close                    close the branch being committed
   --delta                    use a delta manifest in the commit process
   --integrate                close all merged-in branches
   -m|--comment COMMENT-TEXT  use COMMENT-TEXT as commit comment
   -M|--message-file FILE     read the commit comment from given file
   --mimetype MIMETYPE        mimetype of check-in comment
   -n|--dry-run               If given, display instead of run actions
   --no-warnings              omit all warnings about file contents
   --nosign                   do not attempt to sign this commit with gpg
   --private                  do not sync changes and their descendants
   --sha1sum                  verify file status using SHA1 hashing rather
                              than relying on file mtimes
   --tag TAG-NAME             assign given tag TAG-NAME to the checkin
