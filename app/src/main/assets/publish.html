<pre>Usage: fossil publish ?--only? TAGS...

Cause artifacts identified by TAGS... to be published (made non-private).
This can be used (for example) to convert a private branch into a public
branch, or to publish a bundle that was imported privately.

If any of TAGS names a branch, then all checkins on the most recent
instance of that branch are included, not just the most recent checkin.

If any of TAGS name checkins then all files and tags associated with
those checkins are also published automatically.  Except if the --only
option is used, then only the specific artifacts identified by TAGS
are published.

If a TAG is already public, this command is a harmless no-op.
