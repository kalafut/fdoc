<pre>Usage: fossil remote-url ?URL|off?

Query and/or change the default server URL used by the "pull", "push",
and "sync" commands.

The remote-url is set automatically by a "clone" command or by any
"sync", "push", or "pull" command that specifies an explicit URL.
The default remote-url is used by auto-syncing and by "sync", "push",
"pull" that omit the server URL.

See clone usage for possible URL formats.
