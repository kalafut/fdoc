<pre>Usage: fossil sync ?URL? ?options?

Synchronize the local repository with a remote repository.  This is
the equivalent of running both "push" and "pull" at the same time.
Use the "-R REPO" or "--repository REPO" command-line options
to specify an alternative repository file.

See clone usage for possible URL formats.

If the URL is not specified, then the URL from the most recent
successful clone, push, pull, remote-url, or sync command is used.

The URL specified normally becomes the new "remote-url" used for
subsequent push, pull, and sync operations.  However, the "--once"
command-line option makes the URL a one-time-use URL that is not
saved.

Use the --private option to sync private branches with the
remote repository.
