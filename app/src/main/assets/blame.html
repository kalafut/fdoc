<pre>fossil (annotate|blame|praise) ?OPTIONS? FILENAME

Output the text of a file with markings to show when each line of
the file was last modified.  The "annotate" command shows line numbers
and omits the username.  The "blame" and "praise" commands show the user
who made each checkin and omits the line number.

Options:
  --filevers                 Show file version numbers rather than check-in versions
  -l|--log                   List all versions analyzed
  -n|--limit N               Only look backwards in time by N versions
  -w|--ignore-all-space      Ignore white space when comparing lines
  -Z|--ignore-trailing-space Ignore whitespace at line end
