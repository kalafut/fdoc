<pre>Usage: fossil addremove ?OPTIONS?

Do all necessary "add" and "rm" commands to synchronize the repository
with the content of the working checkout:

 *  All files in the checkout but not in the repository (that is,
    all files displayed using the "extras" command) are added as
    if by the "add" command.

 *  All files in the repository but missing from the checkout (that is,
    all files that show as MISSING with the "status" command) are
    removed as if by the "rm" command.

The command does not "commit".  You must run the "commit" separately
as a separate step.

Files and directories whose names begin with "." are ignored unless
the --dotfiles option is used.

The --ignore option overrides the "ignore-glob" setting, as do the
--case-sensitive option with the "case-sensitive" setting and the
--clean option with the "clean-glob" setting. See the documentation
on the "settings" command for further information.

The -n|--dry-run option shows what would happen without actually doing anything.

This command can be used to track third party software.

Options:
  --case-sensitive <BOOL> override case-sensitive setting
  --dotfiles              include files beginning with a dot (".")
  --ignore <CSG>          ignore files matching patterns from the
                          comma separated list of glob patterns.
  --clean <CSG>           also ignore files matching patterns from
                          the comma separated list of glob patterns.
  -n|--dry-run            If given, display instead of run actions
