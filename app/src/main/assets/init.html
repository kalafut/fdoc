<pre>Usage: fossil new ?OPTIONS? FILENAME
   Or: fossil init ?OPTIONS? FILENAME

Create a repository for a new project in the file named FILENAME.
This command is distinct from "clone".  The "clone" command makes
a copy of an existing project.  This command starts a new project.

By default, your current login name is used to create the default
admin user. This can be overridden using the -A|--admin-user
parameter.

By default, all settings will be initialized to their default values.
This can be overridden using the --template parameter to specify a
repository file from which to copy the initial settings.  When a template
repository is used, almost all of the settings accessible from the setup
page, either directly or indirectly, will be copied.  Normal users and
their associated permissions will not be copied; however, the system
default users "anonymous", "nobody", "reader", "developer", and their
associated permissions will be copied.

Options:
   --template      FILE      copy settings from repository file
   --admin-user|-A USERNAME  select given USERNAME as admin user
   --date-override DATETIME  use DATETIME as time of the initial checkin
                             (default: do not create an initial checkin)
