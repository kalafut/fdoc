<pre>Usage: fossil all SUBCOMMAND ...

The ~/.fossil file records the location of all repositories for a
user.  This command performs certain operations on all repositories
that can be useful before or after a period of disconnected operation.

On Win32 systems, the file is named "_fossil" and is located in
%LOCALAPPDATA%, %APPDATA% or %HOMEPATH%.

Available operations are:

   changes    Shows all local checkouts that have uncommitted changes.
              This operation has no additional options.

   clean      Delete all "extra" files in all local checkouts.  Extreme
              caution should be exercised with this command because its
              effects cannot be undone.  Use of the --dry-run option to
              carefully review the local checkouts to be operated upon
              and the --whatif option to carefully review the files to
              be deleted beforehand is highly recommended.  The command
              line options supported by the clean command itself, if any
              are present, are passed along verbatim.

   dbstat     Run the "dbstat" command on all repositories.

   extras     Shows "extra" files from all local checkouts.  The command
              line options supported by the extra command itself, if any
              are present, are passed along verbatim.

   ignore     Arguments are repositories that should be ignored by
              subsequent clean, extras, list, pull, push, rebuild, and
              sync operations.  The -c|--ckout option causes the listed
              local checkouts to be ignored instead.

   info       Run the "info" command on all repositories.

   list | ls  Display the location of all repositories.  The -c|--ckout
              option causes all local checkouts to be listed instead.

   pull       Run a "pull" operation on all repositories.  Only the
              --verbose option is supported.

   push       Run a "push" on all repositories.  Only the --verbose
              option is supported.

   rebuild    Rebuild on all repositories.  The command line options
              supported by the rebuild command itself, if any are
              present, are passed along verbatim.  The --force and
              --randomize options are not supported.

   sync       Run a "sync" on all repositories.  Only the --verbose
              option is supported.

   setting    Run the "setting", "set", or "unset" commands on all
   set        repositories.  These command are particularly useful in
   unset      conjunction with the "max-loadavg" setting which cannot
              otherwise be set globally.

Repositories are automatically added to the set of known repositories
when one of the following commands are run against the repository:
clone, info, pull, push, or sync.  Even previously ignored repositories
are added back to the list of repositories by these commands.

Options:
  --showfile     Show the repository or checkout being operated upon.
  --dontstop     Continue with other repositories even after an error.
  --dry-run      If given, display instead of run actions.
