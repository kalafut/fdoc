<pre>Usage: fossil update ?OPTIONS? ?VERSION? ?FILES...?

Change the version of the current checkout to VERSION.  Any
uncommitted changes are retained and applied to the new checkout.

The VERSION argument can be a specific version or tag or branch
name.  If the VERSION argument is omitted, then the leaf of the
subtree that begins at the current version is used, if there is
only a single leaf.  VERSION can also be "current" to select the
leaf of the current version or "latest" to select the most recent
check-in.

If one or more FILES are listed after the VERSION then only the
named files are candidates to be updated, and any updates to them
will be treated as edits to the current version. Using a directory
name for one of the FILES arguments is the same as using every
subdirectory and file beneath that directory.

If FILES is omitted, all files in the current checkout are subject
to being updated and the version of the current checkout is changed
to VERSION. Any uncommitted changes are retained and applied to the
new checkout.

The -n or --dry-run option causes this command to do a "dry run".
It prints out what would have happened but does not actually make
any changes to the current checkout or the repository.

The -v or --verbose option prints status information about
unchanged files in addition to those file that actually do change.

Options:
  --case-sensitive <BOOL> override case-sensitive setting
  --debug          print debug information on stdout
  --latest         acceptable in place of VERSION, update to latest version
  --force-missing  force update if missing content after sync
  -n|--dry-run     If given, display instead of run actions
  -v|--verbose     print status information about all files
  -W|--width <num> Width of lines (default is to auto-detect). Must be >20
                   or 0 (= no limit, resulting in a single line per entry).
