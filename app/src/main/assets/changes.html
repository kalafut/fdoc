<pre>Usage: fossil changes ?OPTIONS?

Report on the edit status of all files in the current checkout.

Pathnames are displayed according to the "relative-paths" setting,
unless overridden by the --abs-paths or --rel-paths options.

Options:
   --abs-paths       Display absolute pathnames.
   --rel-paths       Display pathnames relative to the current working
                     directory.
   --sha1sum         Verify file status using SHA1 hashing rather
                     than relying on file mtimes.
   --header          Identify the repository if there are changes
   -v|--verbose      Say "(none)" if there are no changes
