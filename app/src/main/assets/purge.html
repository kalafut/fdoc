<pre>The purge command removes content from a repository and stores that content
in a "graveyard".  The graveyard exists so that content can be recovered
using the "fossil purge undo" command.

  fossil purge cat UUID...

     Write the content of one or more artifacts in the graveyard onto
     standard output.

  fossil purge ?checkins? TAGS... ?OPTIONS?

     Move the checkins identified by TAGS and all of their descendants
     out of the repository and into the graveyard.  The "checkins" 
     subcommand keyword is option and can be omitted as long as TAGS
     does not conflict with any other subcommand.

     If a TAGS includes a branch name then it means all the checkins
     on the most recent occurrance of that branch.

          --explain         Make no changes, but show what would happen.
          --dry-run         Make no chances.

  fossil purge list|ls ?-l?

     Show the graveyard of prior purges.  The -l option gives more
     detail in the output.

  fossil purge obliterate ID...

     Remove one or more purge events from the graveyard.  Once a purge
     event is obliterated, it can no longer be undone.

  fossil purge undo ID

     Restore the content previously removed by purge ID.
