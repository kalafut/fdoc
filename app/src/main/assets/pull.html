<pre>Usage: fossil pull ?URL? ?options?

Pull changes from a remote repository into the local repository.
Use the "-R REPO" or "--repository REPO" command-line options
to specify an alternative repository file.

See clone usage for possible URL formats.

If the URL is not specified, then the URL from the most recent
clone, push, pull, remote-url, or sync command is used.

The URL specified normally becomes the new "remote-url" used for
subsequent push, pull, and sync operations.  However, the "--once"
command-line option makes the URL a one-time-use URL that is not
saved.

Use the --private option to pull private branches from the
remote repository.
